          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Hagios School of Life was founded in 2011 by Ps. Samuel Julianto Suwondo, Pastor of Hagios Family - Pentecostal Church in Indonesia. It provides educational services for children of Pre-School level, Kindergarten level, Primary level and Secondary Level. The school aims to equip students with knowledge, Biblical wisdom, and characters of Christ, in doing so training them to live their utmost for God's glory and preparing them to enter tertiary education, employment, and entrepreneurship.
            Ps. Suwondo's had considered establishing a Christian school for years. Concerned about the increasing cases of juvenile delinquency and degradation of moral values among youths, he felt that there was an urgent need of a Christian education which would cultivate students' faith as well as their academic performance. Spending many years to seek the right curriculum, finally Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) was chosen because of its Bible-based curriculum which emphasizes on character 
            training as well as academic excellence and also for its independence, individual, and mastery learning system. The curriculum enables successful candidates to obtain International Certificate of Christian Education (ICCE) which is comparable to that of Cambridge. In addition of ACE, HSOL also offers an opportunity to add local subjects to the study course to obtain certificates of Paket A (Elementary Level), Paket B (Junior High Level), and Paket C (Senior High Level) thus also qualifying graduates 
            to enroll in Indonesian tertiary education institutions. ACE is the curriculum used in Kindergarten-grade 12, whereas the Pre-School level (Playgroup and Toddlers) uses a curriculum developed by HSOL.
            HSol has made quite significant progress for the last couple of years. Although it might not be a giant leap, it is such a tremendous blessing. Just like how the students make little paces throughout their learning process while doing their PACEs, so does the school hope to continually strive for excellence, pace by pace.
